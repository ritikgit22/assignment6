        "**Vectorization**\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectorization is a technique that replaces explicit loops with optimized array operations. It allows NumPy to perform operations on entire arrays element-wise, without the need for explicit Python loops. This leads to a significant performance boost, as these operations are often implemented in highly optimized C code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In the vectorized approach, the addition operation is performed on entire arrays in a single step, which is much faster than the loop-based approach.\n",

        "**Broadcasting**\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting is a powerful feature that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays with different shapes, as long as certain conditions are met. NumPy automatically expands the dimensions of smaller arrays to match the shape of the larger array, enabling operations between arrays of different sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rules for Broadcasting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Shape Compatibility:** The arrays must be compatible in shape. This means that either their shapes are identical, or one of them has a shape of 1 in a particular dimension.\n",
        "2. **Dimension Expansion:** If the shapes are not identical, the smaller array is stretched or broadcast to match the shape of the larger array.\n",
        "3. **Broadcasting Direction:** Broadcasting occurs along the leading dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
        "b = np.array([10, 20])\n",
        "\n",
        "c = a * b  # Broadcasting b to match the shape of a\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the array `b` is broadcast to match the shape of `a`, and the multiplication is performed element-wise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits of Vectorization and Broadcasting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Performance:** By eliminating Python loops, vectorization and broadcasting significantly improve the performance of array operations.\n",
        "- **Readability:** Vectorized operations often lead to more concise and readable code.\n",
        "- **Conciseness:** Broadcasting allows you to perform complex operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit loops or reshaping.\n",
